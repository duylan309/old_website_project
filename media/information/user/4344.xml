      <about>Hi, I’m a Vietnamese passionate, enthusiastic freelancer. I’m about to graduate from my university by next year. To advance in my career as well as to have prospect of succeeding in my future life, I need to get everything well-prepared from now on. Therefore, partime-jobs and interships will give me many good chances to gain work skills and experiences.</about>
      <skill>I have 6- month experience in shop assistant and 1-year experience in coffee shop. &#13;
&#13;
I am the freshman. I haven’t gained as many skills and experiences in work setting as you expected. However, as a quick learner, I will adapt to all your task requirements, for sure. </skill>
