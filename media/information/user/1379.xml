      <about>As an undergraduate student in charge of Business Administration. I am a devoted, dedicated and thoughtful person. I respect my time and also other people’s time so that I am always on time, and meet the deadline but get work done efficiently. I am creative, think fast, and eager to learn new things so that I can contribute my knowledge to the organization and attain the final target.&#13;
HOBBIES AND INTERESTS	&#13;
I love spending time reading English books and learning languages. I love languages so that I usually attempt to learn more languages at home. I also enjoy meeting new people from other countries because I can learn about new cultures, and I can introduce them my country’s cultures either. I am fond of music, and I found out that I work more effectively, feeling less strain, being more motivated and creative when I listen to music while working. </about>
