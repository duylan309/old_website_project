    <about>WELCOME TO DTWO IN D2.&#13;
&#13;
Dtwo Sportspub is the newest addition to the Al Fresco’s Group of restaurants/bars in Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
Dtwo was established to fill a need for a “Pub” in District 2, HCMC, that not only satisfies all of your sporting viewing pleasure, but satisfies your tastebuds too.&#13;
&#13;
With multiple satellite and streaming options available on 9 TV’s around the Pub, rest assured that we are covering most of the bases at Dtwo.&#13;
&#13;
Be sure to ask our managers if there is something you want to watch and we will try our best to satisfy your needs…. within reason.. Ice fishing on the North Pole, is not televised!!&#13;
&#13;
Whilst enjoying watching your local team smash the opposition, you can tuck into some great food options… Home comfort options such as Pies, Roasts, Bangers n’ Mash, Fish &amp; Chips…&#13;
&#13;
Check out our Menu in the tab above.&#13;
&#13;
Last but no means least…. Sport and Pub Grub need to be washed down with something… yeap… we don’t let you down there either… 3 draught beers, a draught cider and of course a stocked to the rafters bottle beer, spirit and wine selection.&#13;
&#13;
So, what you waiting for…. Get down to Dtwo in D2…we look forward to seeing you real soon.</about>
